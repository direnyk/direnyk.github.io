    <p> This is my about me article.The cultural appropriation forum proved to be an interesting topic because of its delicate subject matter and the vast amount of cultures represented throughout the United States. Unlike other countries that have a more homogenous culture, the U.S. does not focus on the importance of culture but rather the profitability of culture. The media has a big role in this because it is through the media we see cultural appropriation and how people from one specific culture can devalue and monetize another’s culture. The U.S. has made this an acceptable fact because of our lack of knowledge and respect for culture in general. An interesting thing brought up in the forum was whether monetary compensation would suffice for culturally appropriating another culture.
